<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The launch occurred at 10:35 AM local time (02:35 UTC) on January 17 with the Shiyan-13 payload inserted into a 468 x 493 km Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO) with an inclination of 97.44 degrees. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This particular orbit is often used for imaging and weather satellites, as it ensures that the illumination angle stays the same for the satellite as it passes over different areas. </span></p>

The only information about the payload is that it will be used for space environment sensing and related technology tests. This explanation was given for previous Shiyan satellites as well.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On this particular launch, a new two-meter diameter satellite-launcher separation device debuted to meet the classified payload&#8217;s special needs.</span></p>
<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=long+march+2D" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The rocket used for Monday&#8217;s launch, CZ-2D,</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is a two-stage orbital rocket manufactured by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST). It is a launcher specified for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and SSO operations and can lift up to 3,500 kg to the former, and 1,300 kg to the latter orbit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The rocket has launched 58 times &#8211; including today&#8217;s flight. Of these, only one was a partial failure. </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/12/superview-duo-long-march-2d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the launch of Super View-1 in December 2016</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the rocket delivered the payloads to a lower-than-expected orbit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The first flight of the CZ-2D took place almost 30 years ago, in August of 1992, and while it shares the name with other rockets of the Chang Zheng 2 family, its origins are not based on the CZ-2. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Instead, it uses the Chang Zheng 4 as a design foundation.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_54357" style="width: 1766px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54357" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-54357 size-full" src="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-01-13-024114.jpg" alt="" width="1756" height="887" srcset="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-01-13-024114.jpg 1756w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-01-13-024114-350x177.jpg 350w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-01-13-024114-630x318.jpg 630w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-01-13-024114-768x388.jpg 768w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-01-13-024114-1170x591.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1756px) 100vw, 1756px" /><p id="caption-attachment-54357" class="wp-caption-text">Long March 2D lifting off during a previous mission.</p></div>
<p>At liftoff, the rocket masses 232,250 kg with a height of 41.05 meters. Its diameter is 3.35 meters in both stages.</p>
<p>The first stage stands 27.91 meters tall with a liftoff mass of 182,000 kg, including the propellant and oxidizer. With that, it makes up more than 75% of the mass of the vehicle at liftoff. It is powered by four YF-21C engines, which provide 2,961.6 kN of thrust at liftoff with 260 seconds of specific impulse.</p>
<p>The YF-21C uses the hypergolic propellant mix of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), which ignite upon contact. This brings the advantage of a more easy ignition, as well as the ability to store the propellants in the tanks at room temperature. However, this comes with the tradeoff of extreme toxicity and less energy density compared to cryogenic propellant mixes.</p>
<p>For the YF-21C, the UDMH is the fuel while the N2O4 functions as the oxidizer. This combination is used in several engines of the early Chang Zheng series (such as Chang Zheng 2, 3, and 4) but was phased out slowly by the new generation of Chang Zheng rockets (such as Chang Zheng 7 and 9) that will use propellants such as methane, hydrogen, and RP-1 kerosene.</p>
<p>After the first stage burn is concluded, the stage is thrown away and falls on the mainland of China. In the past, rocket stages have sometimes hit villages and populated areas. This not only brings danger to the villages with the dropping stage itself but also with the highly toxic leftover propellants which can harm people close to the impact zone.</p>
<p>The CZ-2D&#8217;s second stage stands 10.9 meters tall and 3.35 meters in diameter. It masses 52,700 kg and uses the same fuel mix as the first stage. It is powered by a single YF-22C main engine, which can provide up to 742.04 kN of thrust at 300 seconds of specific impulse.</p>
<p>Four YF-23C vernier engines help to steer the second stage on its way to the desired orbit. In this setup, the combination of vernier and main engines is called the YF-24C.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After the burn of the second stage, the payload is separated from the rocket. In rare cases, the rocket can also feature a YZ-3 third stage for additional orbital maneuvering and to reach higher orbits. So far it was only used for the Yunhai-2 launch in December 2018; however, the upper stage is not exclusive to the CZ-2D and can be used on other CZ family rockets as well. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The launch was conducted from the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/tag/taiyuan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center (TSLC)</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in north China, a complex used for a wide range of Chinese launch vehicles and as a launch site for intercontinental ballistic missiles. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rockets are transported by railway to the launch center, a common practice in Chinese launch infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">TSLC was first opened in 1968 and currently features three launch pads: Launchpad 7, which can launch the CZ-1, CZ-2, and CZ-4 rockets; pad 9, which can launch only the latter two; and pad 16, which is used for launches of the Chang Zheng 6.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This was the first launch out of China in 2022, and the fourth orbital launch worldwide this year. Over the upcoming year, China plans more than 40 launches of the Chang Zheng family. More than 15 of these will utilize the CZ-2D. This comes after 48 Chang Zheng launches in 2021, of which six were on board the CZ-2D. </span></p>

Rollout to Launch Pad 39B will be no earlier than mid-February after an engine computer needed to be replaced at the end of the year.</p>
<p>In addition to finishing functional checks and closing the Space Launch System (SLS) Core Stage engine compartment out for launch, EGS and Jacobs are also preparing to re-run a countdown sequencing test to verify that the ground-based launch sequencer is ready to conduct launch countdowns for the integrated Orion and SLS vehicle. The first vehicle trip to the pad will be to conduct a full launch countdown demonstration test called the Wet Dress Rehearsal.</p>
<p>The schedule still projects that the vehicle could be ready to launch no sooner than the end of lunar launch window in March, but doesn&#8217;t leave much time to address issues and later windows beginning in April are more realistic.<br />
<span id="more-83544"></span></p>
<p><b>Closing out Core Stage aft compartment after engine controller replacement</b></p>
<p>With the broken Core Stage engine controller replaced over the New Year&#8217;s holidays, EGS and Jacobs were able to finish functional checkouts of the most complicated part of SLS on the evening of January 12. &#8220;We did that last night and everything worked out pretty well,&#8221; EGS Lead NASA Test Director (NTD) for Integrated Testing, said in an interview on January 13 with NASASpaceflight.</p>
<p>SLS is derived from the Space Shuttle vehicle and the Core Stage combines the launch systems from the reusable Shuttle Orbiter and disposable External Tank into an expendable, in-line, ground-started sustainer stage. The most complicated part of the Core Stage is the engine section where the cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) propellant is fed by the stage to the RS-25 engines.</p>
<p>With an engine controller that wouldn&#8217;t power up, final functional checks of the stage&#8217;s engine section components and the four RS-25s were put on hold while <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/12/engine-controller-artemis-1-delay/">troubleshooting occurred from Thanksgiving through most of December</a>. The issue also helped push the earliest lunar window that Artemis 1 could be ready for launch from February to March.</p>
<p>The functional checkouts of the Core Stage Main Propulsion System (MPS) and RS-25 engines verified that they are again configured and ready to be loaded and fired, this time for launch. The functional testing was the last part of Program Specific Engineering Tests (PSET) on the base elements of the new launch vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The testing] included all of your pneumatics and avionics checkouts of the Core Stage,&#8221; Florez said. &#8220;That [also] includes your flight readiness test of all four engines, especially after we replaced the engine controller on the number four engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything checked out well, we did our checks on the thrust vector control system (TVC), all the actuators. [We] gimbaled the nozzles and then we concluded the test by closing out the hydraulic system for flight and also doing a spin test of the auxiliary power units that provide hydraulic power to the engines for both steering and also for engine control.&#8221;</p>

<p>With those functional checks complete, the Core Stage engine section can now be closed out for launch over the next few weeks. &#8220;Getting that whole engine section closed out is a big milestone towards rolling out,&#8221; Cliff Lanham, NASA Senior Vehicle Operations manager for EGS at KSC, said in the January 13 interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that PSETs [for the Core Stage are] over, we can get into our engine final inspection and then start closing out the engine section and then finally get into the engine blanket installations.&#8221; A decision was made to have Core Stage prime contractor Boeing perform the installation of the engine-mounted heatshield (EMHS) blankets, which is the most time-consuming task in that part of preparations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have engaged Boeing, they will be helping us out with the engine blankets now, so that work will be going on seven days a week and that pulled back our critical path by a few days,&#8221; Lanham noted.</p>
<p>The powerheads of the four RS-25 engines <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/11/aerojet-rocketdyne-rs-25-success-maf-rollout/">fit into the engine section of the stage through large openings in the boattail</a>; the EMHS blankets are a component of the thermal protection system (TPS), enclosing those openings to provide a thermal and environmental barrier between the engine section and the outside.</p>
<p>Boeing conducted and supervised vehicle operations during the Core Stage Green Run at Stennis, and has already performed the lengthy installation of the EMHS blankets as a part of preparations for both Hot-Fire tests that were performed in January and March, 2021. <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/05/tps-repairs-core-stage-work-updatei/">Boeing has been performing post Green Run refurbishment and modifications</a> on the Core Stage at KSC on a seven day per week schedule since <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/05/nasa-egs-jacobs-sls-artemis-1-stacking/">it arrived at the launch site in late April</a>.</p>
<p>That post Green Run refurbishment &#8220;traveled work&#8221; is also wrapping up. &#8220;We have one more leak check on a purge bag for the bleed [modification] that has to be completed, we&#8217;re actually planning on doing that tomorrow,&#8221; Lanham said during the January 13 interview. &#8220;In the intertank area there is some foam trimming that has to be done on the LH2 forward dome and we&#8217;re looking at finishing that up next week, so from a traveled work standpoint we are 98-99 percent complete and plan to finish that up mid next week in total.&#8221;</p>
<p>Final closeouts and TPS detailing work are also continuing around other areas on the integrated Orion-SLS Artemis 1 vehicle. &#8220;We&#8217;re continuing with our [Solid Rocket] Booster closeouts, all systems tunnel covers are on both the left-hand and right-hand side now,&#8221; Lanham said.</p>

Artemis 1 is an uncrewed test flight for both Orion and SLS, but the Crew Access Arm allows NASA to install late-stow payloads in the Orion Crew Module for this mission.)</strong></em></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been doing a lot of we call it RT-455 work, which is the cork material, so we&#8217;ve been working on that on both [Boosters], there&#8217;s a lot of effort there with our DFI runs, that all has to be closed out with this material, as well as the areas between the different systems tunnel covers.&#8221; RT-455 is a room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) material that is applied to exterior seams as a weather seal and for thermal protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking to be done towards the end of January with the Booster closeouts, notwithstanding anything required [for] testing there,&#8221; Lanham noted. &#8220;We continue to put RTV on the exterior of the Orion as we prepare for rollout for WDR, so that work is ongoing and that is time-consuming work as well, but that&#8217;s going well.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Remaining tests and checkout before rollout and WDR</b></p>
<p>Getting the Core Stage PSET work completed has drawn engine section closeouts more or less even with the Integrated Test and Check-Out (ITCO) schedule to rolling out to the launch pad. &#8220;Our critical path previously was running through our engine section with our blanket installation and final inspections and closeouts and then getting into confidence checks and then ultimately our final closeouts for roll,&#8221; Lanham explained.</p>
<p>With Boeing working on the flight EMHS blanket installations seven days a week, Lanham said, &#8220;that pulled back off our critical path by a few days and our ITCO testing basically is now our critical path.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now [that] we&#8217;ve finished Core Stage PSET, [we have] ICPS (Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage) PSET next week, then we&#8217;ve got a Countdown Sequencing Test Run 2, and then we get into our Flight Termination System Part 1 testing, and then we get into closeouts [for rollout] and that&#8217;s kind of our critical path right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>ICPS is the in-space second stage on the SLS Block 1 vehicle; functional testing was partially completed in early December before the remainder was temporarily deferred. &#8220;We&#8217;ve run a lot of the tests, a lot of the guidance and flight control checks have been done,&#8221; Florez said. &#8220;We [also] completed a big chunk of the electrical portion, which includes all the flight control tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no issues [with the ICPS PSETs], but we had to get into [Communications] End-To-End testing,&#8221; Lanham added. &#8220;Now we&#8217;re picking up the tail end of that back up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Communications End-To-End Test was conducted in mid-December; the test required reserving time with a large set of NASA&#8217;s communications resources, which Orion in particular will engage during its trip from the Earth to the Moon and back on Artemis 1.</p>

<p><em><strong>(Photo Caption: Members of the Artemis 1 Launch Team&#8217;s Integration Console are seen during a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/kennedys-artemis-i-team-readies-for-nasas-historic-launch">day of launch simulation on December 13</a>. The launch team will be conducting and overseeing final critical pre-launch testing in addition to the countdown operations for the Wet Dress Rehearsal and the Artemis 1 launch itself.)</strong></em></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very complex test, it requires multiple assets across the country,&#8221; Florez said. &#8220;It requires the Deep Space Network [and] all those ground stations, as well as the Tracking Data and Relay Satellites on orbit, so trying to schedule that up is a monumental task on its own for the amount of time that we need to test. We prioritized that test and worked other things around it, due to the assets and the schedule constraints.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we got into the test, everything went pretty smoothly for the Comm End-To-End test. We verified all the comm paths that we have. You&#8217;re essentially simulating a mission profile, so you&#8217;re making sure that you have data going through all the different legs, network legs, that you would for a mission with the different data rates and making sure that everybody that needs to receive the data and send commands can do that effectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a part of the regular schedule reworking that goes on during a launch campaign, EGS and Jacobs rescheduled the remainder of the ICPS PSETs and that work is now expected to resume early the week of January 17. &#8220;As we got the engine controller changed out, we wanted to get into Core Stage PSET immediately, so that kind of pushed the ICPS PSET to the right some,&#8221; Lanham noted. &#8220;But now we&#8217;re ready to get back into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hadn&#8217;t started the MPS testing, we&#8217;re getting back into it now that we have some window [in the schedule],&#8221; Florez said. &#8220;What we&#8217;re focusing in on now is the MPS/Cryo tests and some of the reaction control tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>One issue with the ICPS was seen late last year. A leak was discovered in a portion of a gaseous helium purge line on the forward end of the ICPS, but is not seen as a constraint.</p>
<p>A statement from the SLS Program emailed to NASASpaceflight by NASA spokesperson Tracy McMahan said: &#8220;During checkout and testing, engineers detected a larger-than-anticipated amount of helium in the cavity between Interim Cryogenic Propulsion stage (ICPS) and the Orion stage adapter. Follow-on testing and analysis identified a helium purge line in the ICPS vent system as the probable source of the helium.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The purge line is part of the ground support used to purge the ICPS on the ground,&#8221; the statement continued. &#8220;At this time, the team does not believe any flight hardware action is required nor will this issue impact the wet dress rehearsal schedule. The team continues to assess test data and will closely monitor the situation during ongoing tests and checkouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the ICPS PSETs are completed, the second run of the Countdown Sequencing Test is currently scheduled for around January 24. The first run was performed on December 20.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re essentially performing a launch countdown but inside the VAB, so you&#8217;re simulating some things, you obviously don&#8217;t have any [cryogenic propellant] and fluids onboard the vehicle so you have to simulate those tasks, but a lot of the [command and control computer] sequencing [is what] we&#8217;re checking out,&#8221; Florez said. &#8220;The intent there is to make sure that the software and the command and control system between the ground and the vehicle systems are talking to each other and are in sync.&#8221;</p>
<p>The test runs through the critical, terminal launch countdown sequence, which is executed by computers as the volume and speed of necessary, coordinated actions and verification checks increases to very high levels. The first test cutoff a few seconds earlier than was desired.</p>
<p>&#8220;The test went very well, we learned a lot of critical things, but towards the end of the test we learned something new that prevented us from going down further in the count,&#8221; Florez said. &#8220;The way the vehicle emulators that we use for software testing are built they behave a little bit differently [than the actual vehicle], so that&#8217;s what we learned, and due to that we&#8217;re changing the process and the procedures and [performing] the second run of the test.&#8221;</p>

<p><em><strong>(Photo Caption: The Core Stage intertank is seen flanked by the forward skirts of the two Solid Rocket Boosters in VAB High Bay 3 on December 20. Access inside those three areas is needed to perform final installations of Flight Termination System components and verification that the safety system is fully functional. Testing inside the intertank and forward skirts will be one of the final tasks in the VAB before the Artemis 1 vehicle rolls out to the pad, prior to both the Wet Dress Rehearsal and launch.)</strong></em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/09/artemis-1-countdown-deliberations/">Ground Launch Sequencer (GLS) controls the terminal countdown until about 30 seconds before liftoff</a>, when control of the countdown is divided between the SLS flight computers and the GLS. The SLS flight computers take over control of the vehicle at that point, but the GLS not only continues to monitor the vehicle performance, but also continues to control and monitor ground systems.</p>
<p>During the Countdown Sequencing Test the GLS was run against the real, fully-integrated Artemis 1 Orion and SLS vehicle. Emulators were still used to simulate a &#8220;wet&#8221; vehicle with the SLS stages loaded with their LH2 and LOX propellant, but the ground sequencer was working with an otherwise real set of flight computers, spacecraft and rocket hardware, and instrumentation.</p>
<p>The first test run didn&#8217;t quite make it through the handoff of vehicle control from the ground to the vehicle. &#8220;We got within four seconds of where we wanted to terminate the test,&#8221; Lanham said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think the fact that we did not do that handoff is exactly why, for the most part, we want to go and re-run the test, as well as picking up [changes to] the LCC (Launch Commit Criteria) limits and to get the software changed and accommodate those LCC limits.&#8221;</p>
<p>The highest fidelity test of the terminal countdown sequence will be performed as a part of the Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), where the vehicle will be fueled and prepared for ignition and liftoff just as it will be on launch day, with the countdown being stopped only a couple of seconds before engine start.</p>
<p>The last major ITCO test before the first rollout to the launch pad will checkout some parts of the Flight Termination System (FTS). For Artemis 1, the final installations and checkout of the FTS are divided into two parts, with first part performed before the first rollout and the WDR and the second part done back in the VAB just before launch.</p>
<p>Once the FTS system is fully certified with an end-to-end functional test during the second part, <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/12/artemis-1-update-dec-2021/">that signifies the beginning of a 20-day period of time where it can be used for a launch</a> before needing to be recertified; the system won&#8217;t be fully active for the WDR, so only part of the installation and testing will be performed before the first rollout. &#8220;After we connect ordnance, we do the resistance checks and all the checkouts required on the ordnance system to make sure that it was installed correctly but it&#8217;s not necessarily the certification for launch,&#8221; Florez said.</p>
<p>Although the ordnance is put in place during the first part of installation, Florez explained that it is not fully connected or integrated into the system until the second part of the checkout. &#8220;You leave the ordnance installed, but it&#8217;s not connected to the vehicle, to the firing lines,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The [second part] really certifies the FTS system for launch, and that&#8217;s a test where we have live communications with the [Eastern Test] Range where we make sure that the signals are coming across.&#8221;</p>

<p><em><strong>(Photo Caption: An engineer (left foreground) performs closeouts on the left-hand Solid Rocket Booster for Artemis 1 in the VAB on January 10. The vehicle will be outside in the weather out at the launch pad and then experience an extreme thermal environment from combustion and aerodynamic heating; room temperature vulcanizer is being applied in the gaps between the large-area/acreage thermal protection system coverings on the exterior of the vehicle.)</strong></em></p>
<p>The first part of the final FTS install and checkout requires access to areas inside the Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) forward skirts and the Core Stage intertank; once that work is complete, which would be in early February on the current schedule, EGS and Jacobs can configure those internal volumes for rollout and start getting into final preparations to roll the Mobile Launcher with the vehicle out to Launch Pad 39B.</p>
<p>There are a few other tests that the processing team plans to work into the schedule before launch. &#8220;We have one other small test that we&#8217;re doing which is a test that checks out the data acquisition units &#8212; the DFI (Development Flight Instrumentation) network per-se &#8212; on Orion, ICPS, the Core Stage and Boosters, which we&#8217;re planning on running right after the Countdown Sequencing Test,&#8221; Florez said.</p>
<p>Another is a Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter acoustic impulse test. &#8220;That&#8217;s really a test of opportunity which is not so critical for Artemis 1, it&#8217;s critical for further missions from a data collection perspective, but we are still planning on running that,&#8221; Florez said. &#8220;We&#8217;re targeting that after we come back from WDR, we&#8217;ll be in a better configuration to run that prior to launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another task on the schedule that will be worked in parallel with critical path activities is the <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/08/lvsa-arrives-ksc-for-artemis-1/">swap of the ICPS flight computer and batteries</a>. Lanham said that the timing of that depends on when the flight units are delivered: &#8220;Our plan would be to get that in before WDR, but if not, then obviously we would do it post WDR, but the plan is still to swap out that box.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Setting a launch date coupled to WDR demonstration</b></p>
<p>The Artemis 1 vehicle stacked on its Mobile Launcher will first be rolled out to Launch Pad 39B for the Wet Dress Rehearsal. The Mobile Launcher has made multiple trips to the pad on its own for different phases of <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/12/nasa-egs-first-sls-ml-fueling-tests/">Multi-Element Verification and Validation (MEV&amp;V)</a> and the upcoming trip to the pad is in essence the final phase of integrated testing that brings in the Orion-SLS vehicle for a full launch countdown demonstration test between the vehicle and ground elements.</p>
<p>Following resolution of the power failure in the RS-25 engine controller, current estimates of the soonest that the hardware could be ready to roll out to the pad for the WDR are mid-February, with the soonest that the hardware could be ready for launch in mid/late March. <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/11/artemis-1-launch-periods/">SLS can only launch Orion on Artemis 1 when the Moon is in the right position in its orbit around the Earth</a>, but launch readiness is a measure of when the hardware and the people are ready to go.</p>
<p>Estimates of the soonest that the hardware could reach major milestones like the WDR and launch have moved around significantly. NASA also has estimates that factor in the schedule risk, given this is a new system being prepared for its first flight, which reflect additional time to deal with issues that could come up.</p>
<p>The risk informed estimate hasn&#8217;t changed as much; although it doesn&#8217;t predict when issues like the engine controller power failure will occur, it projects how much additional time would be needed to resolve them. That risk assessed readiness estimate has more consistently pointed at mid April, because it included many weeks of extra time to work through hardware issues and learning curve situations such as with the first Countdown Sequencing Test.</p>

<p>NASA will not set a launch date until after the WDR is completed and they can factor in any additional tasks with already-known work. &#8220;We&#8217;ve continually said that until we get through WDR we won&#8217;t set a launch date, so us getting out in mid-February for WDR allows them to look at March and April as opportunities,&#8221; Lanham said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really can&#8217;t put my finger on it again until we come back from WDR and see if we have any issues there that we&#8217;ve got to go correct.&#8221;  After the WDR test, the vehicle and Mobile Launcher will be rolled back to the VAB for final pre-launch maintenance and servicing.</p>
<p>When the vehicle arrives at Pad 39B for the WDR, EGS and Jacobs will begin countdown preparations, since the test is a full launch countdown minus the last 10 seconds before liftoff. With the vehicle being prepared just as it will be for launch, NASA will have to reserve a spot on the busy <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/02/eastern-range-airport-model/">Eastern Test Range calendar</a> for the test just like the other launch providers do for hazardous operations such as launches and WDR tanking tests.</p>
<p>Finding a spot on the Range calendar may be another complicating factor in the overall pre-launch schedule, as planning for the Comm End-To-End test was. When NASA is ready to perform the WDR, the Range&#8217;s launch calendar may be relatively open and easier to schedule or it may be heavily booked and harder to reserve a spot.</p>

However, they typically don&#8217;t come in different shapes, as nearly every single planet ever discovered is thought to be spherical in shape — except for one.</p>
<p>New data from the European Space Agency&#8217;s (ESA) <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/tag/cheops/">Characterising Exoplanets Satellite (CHEOPS)</a> space observatory, as well as data collected by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and NASA&#8217;s Spitzer Space Telescope, has revealed the shape of an exoplanet that features many extreme characteristics. The CHEOPS data is the first time astrophysicists have ever detected the deformation of an exoplanet and provides valuable information into the internal structure of exoplanets.</p>
<p><span id="more-83521"></span></p>
<p><strong>WASP-103b</strong></p>
<p>The planet in question is WASP-103b, a super-Jupiter <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/tag/exoplanet/">exoplanet</a> located in the constellation Hercules. WASP-103b orbits the star WASP-103, an F-type main-sequence star that is located 1,800 ± 100 light-years away from our solar system. WASP-103 is about 1.7 times larger than our Sun and is around 200 degrees hotter.</p>
<p>WASP-103b has many unique features. Discovered in 2014, it is approximately twice the size and 1.5 times the mass of Jupiter, features an atmosphere that contains water, and orbits its star in less than a day. The exoplanet was discovered via the transit method, wherein a star is observed as an exoplanet transits it &#8212; allowing scientists to calculate the contents of a planet&#8217;s atmosphere (if it has one) and its size.</p>
<div id="attachment_83531" style="width: 804px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83531" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-83531" src="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cheops_reveals_a_rugby_ball-shaped_exoplanet-350x197.png" alt="" width="794" height="447" srcset="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cheops_reveals_a_rugby_ball-shaped_exoplanet-350x197.png 350w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cheops_reveals_a_rugby_ball-shaped_exoplanet-622x350.png 622w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cheops_reveals_a_rugby_ball-shaped_exoplanet-768x432.png 768w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cheops_reveals_a_rugby_ball-shaped_exoplanet-1920x1080.png 1920w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Cheops_reveals_a_rugby_ball-shaped_exoplanet-1170x658.png 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" /><p id="caption-attachment-83531" class="wp-caption-text">ESA infographic providing information on WASP-103b and WASP-103.

<p>The extremely short orbital period of WASP-103b is the main cause of the planet&#8217;s odd shape. The reason for WASP-103b&#8217;s short orbital period is the distance at which it orbits WASP-103 — with the exoplanet&#8217;s semi-major axis being an astonishing 0.01987 astronomical units (AU) — one AU being the approximate average distance between the Sun and the Earth. The smaller the orbit of a planet, the faster it will orbit its host star.</p>
<p>Like Earth, WASP-103b experiences tidal tugging from its host star. However, WASP-103b&#8217;s extremely tight orbit allows WASP-103 to exert a much stronger tidal force on the planet. This powerful tidal tug is what caused the deformation of WASP-103b.</p>
<aside class="penci-sidebar-content widget l2-info"><h4 class="widget-title penci-border-arrow"><span class="inner-arrow">See Also</span></h4><ul><li><a href="https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=32925.0">CHEOPS Mission Updates</a></li><li><a href="http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=49.0">Space Science Forum</a></li><li><a href="http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/l2/">Click here to Join L2</a></li></ul></aside>
<p>Astrophysicists and astronomers who have studied the WASP-103 system had for many years theorized that WASP-103b&#8217;s star-hugging orbit would cause tidal deformation of the planet&#8217;s crust. However, they hadn&#8217;t been able to efficiently measure the exact amount of tidal force exerted on the exoplanet until CHEOPS&#8217; capabilities allowed them to do so.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/07/esa-exoplanet-hunter-cheops-depart-spain-pre-launch-testing/">CHEOPS is able to measure the specific properties of exoplanets</a> by measuring the transits of exoplanets in front of the stars they orbit. As aforementioned, the transit method involved observing a star as an exoplanet crosses in front of it. When this occurs, the amount of light that is emitted by a star will dip and create a light curve, allowing scientists to measure characteristics including the shape, size, and atmospheric contents of the planet.</p>
<p>Most telescopes are able to observe the transiting of an exoplanet; however, CHEOPS&#8217; advanced precision and flexibility allow it to observe very small changes in the light curve produced by an exoplanet transit event. This is precision is what allowed CHEOPS to observe the deformation in WASP-103b&#8217;s shape.</p>
<p>“It’s incredible that Cheops was actually able to reveal this tiny deformation,” says Jacques Laskar of Paris Observatory, Université Paris Sciences et Lettres, and co-author of the research. “This is the first time such analysis has been made, and we can hope that observing over a longer time interval will strengthen this observation and lead to better knowledge of the planet’s internal structure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Using the light curve CHEOPS produced from WASP-103b&#8217;s transit of WASP-103, researchers were able to derive a value known as the Love number. The Love number measures the amount of mass and how mass is distributed within a planet. Having the Love number provides insight into the internal structure of a planet.</p>
<p>The Love number derived for WASP-103b is similar to the Love number of Jupiter &#8212; hinting towards WASP-103b having a similar internal structure to Jupiter&#8217;s, even though WASP-103b is around twice the radius of Jupiter.</p>
<p>“The resistance of a material to being deformed depends on its composition,” explains the study&#8217;s lead author, Susana Barros of Portugal&#8217;s Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço and the University of Porto.</p>
<p>“For example, here on Earth we have tides due to the Moon and the Sun but we can only see tides in the oceans. The rocky part doesn’t move that much. By measuring how much the planet is deformed we can tell how much of it is rocky, gaseous, or water.”</p>
<p>“In principle, we would expect a planet with 1.5 times the mass of the Jupiter to be roughly the same size, so WASP-103b must be very inflated due to heating from its star and maybe other mechanisms,” said Barros.</p>
<p>Although the derived Love number provides some insight into the inner workings of WASP-103b, it is quite high, and there is still some uncertainty in the viability of the number. The recently launched James Webb Space Telescope will work together with CHEOPS in the future to continue measuring the tidal deformation of WASP-103b and other exoplanets like it.</p>
<p>“If we can confirm the details of its internal structure with future observations maybe we could better understand what makes it so inflated. Knowing the size of the core of this exoplanet will also be important to better understand how it formed,&#8221; Barros explained.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On top of the strange deformation of WASP-103b, it also exhibits weird orbital properties with its star.</p>
<p>Typically, when a planet as large as WASP-103b orbits extremely close to a star like WASP-103, the tidal interactions between the two bodies would gradually pull the planet&#8217;s orbit closer to the star, until the planet is eventually engulfed by the star.</p>
<p>However, the exact opposite is happening with WASP-103b.</p>
<p>The measurements taken by CHEOPS of WASP-103b seem to show that the exoplanet is slowly drifting away from its parent star and that its orbital period is increasing. This would suggest that there must be a force stronger than that of WASP-103&#8217;s tidal force pulling the exoplanet away from the star.</p>
<p>Barros and her fellow researchers investigated several different scenarios that tried to tackle the question of what exactly is pulling WASP-103b away from its star. One of these scenarios involved a companion star to WASP-103 that would cause the effects the team saw in the data, while another scenario investigated whether or not an elliptical orbit could be causing the effects that the scientists observed.</p>
<p>The team of researchers was unable to verify if any of the scenarios were correct, but they aren&#8217;t ruling them out. In fact, the orbit of WASP-103b could not be increasing at all and actually be decreasing. However, to confirm this, further observations and transits of WASP-103b are needed.</p>
<p><strong>CHEOPS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/12/esa-arianespace-historic-cheops-exoplanet-launch/">CHEOPS (CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite) launched on December 18, 2019, atop a Soyuz ST-A rocket, flight number VS23, from Kourou, French Guiana</a>. The observatory is operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) in an approximately-700-kilometer sun-synchronous polar orbit.</p>
<p>The primary goal of CHEOPS is to measure the size of exoplanets orbiting stars throughout the universe. Being able to determine the size of an exoplanet allows teams to then estimate its mass, density, composition, formation, and other characteristics. Additionally, CHEOPS is the first mission dedicated to studying exoplanets surrounding nearby stars that have previously been confirmed to have exoplanets. This allows CHEOPS to build off of previous research and data.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cheops: Europe&#039;s exoplanet mission" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EAIUJaaVJ9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>CHEOPS is able to perform these measurements by observing the transits of exoplanets in front of their respective stars, allowing the observatory to create light curves which showcase the characteristics of the exoplanets it is studying. CHEOPS primarily targets exoplanets in the super-Earth to Neptune size range.</p>
<p>“The size of the effect of tidal deformation on an exoplanet transit light curve is very small, but thanks to the very high precision of CHEOPS we are able to see this for the first time,” said Kate Isaak, ESA Project Scientist for CHEOPS.</p>
<p>“This study is an excellent example of the very diverse questions that exoplanet scientists are able to tackle with CHEOPS, illustrating the importance of this flexible follow-up mission,&#8221; said Issak.</p>
<p>As of January 2021, CHEOPS is a little over two years into its mission, which is expected to last three and a half years.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next test conducted was what appeared to be an exercise of the entire Mechazilla system, using the chopsticks in a simulated lift a Starship to a full-stack height before swinging the Ship <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=Ship+QD">Quick Disconnect (QD) arm</a> into place to stabilize the full stack. However, this time the arms did not open wide to the position that they would be in during a launch attempt.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next series of tests included SpaceX hooking a bar between the chopsticks before attaching multiple load test bags to the bar. </span></p>
<p>The Chopsticks were then raised, with the bags empty, to the top of the tower at a previously unseen speed, reaching the top in just under nine minutes. SpaceX later filled four of the bags with water before raising the chopsticks and translating them above the OLM.</p>

<p>Following the fit check stacking of Booster 4 and <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=Ship%2B20">Ship 20</a>, the test campaign for Booster 4 kicked off back on December 17, with SpaceX conducting a partial cryogenic proof test, partially filling B4&#8217;s methane tank with liquid nitrogen (LN2).</p>
<p>These tests are conducted to verify the tanks&#8217; structural integrity and ability to hold the super-chilled liquid methane and liquid oxygen needed for a test flight.</p>
<p>The next test, conducted on December 21, included SpaceX partially filling the liquid oxygen tank with LN2 for the first time, with a repeat performance for the methane tank.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXFVrPFrCJU">The most recent test of Booster 4</a> saw teams fill the liquid oxygen tank with LN2 before filling the methane tank nearly halfway, potentially paving the way for the first round of static fire tests on the OLM.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crews Work on Booster 4&#039;s Engine Section | SpaceX Boca Chica" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g5f15c3ReTo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>However, it has not yet been confirmed that Booster 4, and the OLS Tank Farm, are at the required state of readiness for such a test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceX has not received certification to store methane in their custom-built GSE tanks, as confirmed by regulations from the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates natural gas storage in Texas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should SpaceX opt to move to the next Super Heavy for Static Fire testing, <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=Booster+7">Booster 7</a> would be the vehicle.<br />

<p>Stacking ops have continued in the High Bay, with the Liquid Oxygen (LOX) Aft Tank #5 being rolled into the High Bay ahead of being joined to the rest of the aft tank stack.</p>
<p>Once Aft Tank #5 is joined to the stack, work will shift from the LOX section to the methane section. After the methane section is completed, the Booster Thrust Section will be joined to the LOX section before the methane section is lifted and joined to the LOX section, completing the Booster.</p>
<p>Despite Elon only recently confirming that the next Booster would have <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=Raptor">33 Raptor 2 (R2) engines</a>, the first thrust puck capable of accommodating 33 R2&#8217;s was first spotted in October of 2021. This next Booster has since evolved into Booster 7, with Booster 6 becoming a test tank.</p>
<p>With Ship 20 having conducted a series of Static Fire tests, with the potential for more over the coming weeks, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ship 21&#8217;s tank section has been moved around the Production Site, taking up stints inside both the Mid Bay and High Bay.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While work on Ship 21 has seemingly halted, SpaceX has continued to work on Ship 22, adding hinges to the nosecone barrel, indicating that the barrel could be repurposed to be a cargo bay door pathfinder.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time a cargo bay pathfinder was spotted was in July 2021, when a nosecone barrel was cut open along with part of the nosecone itself. At the time, Elon noted that the exact payload bay door dimensions were yet to be determined and that the volume was roughly 1,000 cubic meters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=Ship+24">crews have started working on Ship 24</a>, with multiple parts spotted and the Common Dome sleeved. <a href="https://twitter.com/BocaChicaGal">Mary (@bocachicagal)</a> spotted the sleeve on December 24 and captured it being put onto the sleeving stand and sleeved on January 3 and 4, respectively.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary also spotted the Mid LOX section on December 10 and the Forward Dome just a few days later on December 12. It would be nearly a month before more work was done on the Forward Dome, when <a href="https://twitter.com/NicAnsuini">Nic (@NicAnsuini)</a> captured it being sleeved on January 6.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, SpaceX has continued to add capacity at the Production site, <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=Wide+Bay">with work on the third level of the new wider High Bay starting</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the previous level, SpaceX has shifted to constructing sections of the Wide Bay on the ground before lifting them onto the previous level. It appears that this change is to speed up construction, as SpaceX has been able to make progress on the second and third levels much faster than the first level.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;Wide Bay&#8221; will allow SpaceX to work on multiple Boosters or Ships at once, something they&#8217;ve been unable to do before.

The launch occurred on Thursday, January 13 at approximately 2:51 PM PST (22:51 UTC). Cosmic Girl took off from the Mojave Air and Space Port before flying out to the launch zone near the Channel Islands off the southern California coast.</p>
<p><span id="more-83436"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=launcherone">The LauncherOne vehicle,</a> making its fourth orbital flight attempt, and the third overall orbital launch of 2022, carried 11 satellites to a 500-kilometer circular orbit inclined 45 degrees to the Equator. This inclination is lower than usual for West Coast launches, and as such Cosmic Girl flew further out over the Pacific than usual.  This allowed LauncherOne to reach the lower-inclination orbit without overflying land.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=cosmic+girl">Cosmic Girl</a> carried the fully fueled LauncherOne rocket under its left wing, attached to a pylon that uses a hard point Boeing had originally built into that wing for carrying a spare engine. The 747 had this capability because its engines were too large to be carried aboard most freighter aircraft at the time it was originally entered into service. An extra engine could then be ferried on a normal 747 flight if needed.</p>

<p>After Cosmic Girl and LauncherOne reached the intended launch zone over the Pacific, the 747 completed a circuit around the zone while the rocket&#8217;s systems were checked out. Once all systems met launch criteria, the crew aboard Cosmic Girl proceeded to the launch point and released LauncherOne.</p>
<p>Seconds after the drop, LauncherOne ignited its first stage NewtonThree engine, which uses liquid oxygen and RP-1 as propellants. The rocket climbed on its southeast-bound trajectory before stage separation around the T+3 minute mark.</p>
<p>The second stage, using a similarly fueled NewtonFour engine, ignited shortly after stage separation. Meanwhile, Cosmic Girl, commanded by chief pilot Eric Bippert and pilots Todd Ericson and Mathew Stannard, returned to its base in Mojave.</p>
<p>Following a second stage 2 burn, LauncherOne successfully deployed the 11 payloads.</p>

<p>Eight of the satellites on this mission are part of the Space Force&#8217;s STP-27VPB mission. These include the Ignis propulsion technology demonstrator, a pair of autonomous docking demonstrator satellites (PAN A/B), and a university payload sponsored by NASA.</p>
<p>The other three satellites are from commercial customers. The Polish company SatRevolution has two payloads onboard this mission: STORK-3 and SteamSat-2. Finally, Adler-1 is flying for Spire Global, in partnership with the Austrian Space Forum and Findus Venture GmbH.</p>
<p>Initially, the “Above the Clouds” mission had been planned to fly the Space Force’s STP-27VPB payloads along with the commercial STORK-3 and SteamSat-2 satellites late last year. However, there was a last-minute payload addition (Adler-1) along with two delays from the initial December 2 launch date, pushing the mission to January 2022.</p>
<p>Several US government agencies, including NASA, are flying payloads under <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=STP">the DoD’s Space Test Program</a> for this flight. The DoD awarded a contract to Virgin Orbit’s subsidiary VOX Space for the STP-27VPB mission as part of a “rapid agile launch” initiative. This intends to enable demonstrations of commercial space technology for military purposes.</p>

<p>The Adler-1 satellite, built by Spire Global in cooperation with the Austrian Space Forum and Findus Venture GmbH, was announced as part of the “Above the Clouds” manifest earlier in December 2021. It was selected to fly on the mission only 20 days after conversations began with Virgin Orbit. 36 hours after official approval for the mission, the satellite was integrated with the payload stack.</p>
<p>The satellite, measuring 30x10x10 centimeters, will attempt to observe and obtain data on <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=space+debris">micro space debris to help refine existing models of space debris orbiting Earth.</a></p>
<p>The Ignis technology demonstrator satellite is a 12-kilogram 6U CubeSat built by Astro Digital of Santa Clara, California. It features a Hall effect ion thruster&#8211;known as the Apollo Constellation Engine&#8211;along with other attitude and navigation control systems. It is built by Astro Digital of Santa Clara, California.</p>
<p>The STORK-3 satellite is a product of Polish company SatRevolution, a repeat customer of Virgin Orbit’s services. STORK-3 is an Earth observation satellite meant to serve the agricultural sector with medium-resolution imagery from orbit. It will join STORK-4 and STORK-5 Marta, <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/06/launcherone-first-operational/">which were launched by Virgin Orbit in June 2021.</a></p>

<p>SatRevolution is also launching SteamSat-2, which is a tech demonstrator for the UK’s SteamJet Space Systems. This satellite is testing water thrusters for use in satellite propulsion in space.</p>
<p>The PAN A/B satellites are a pair of 3U CubeSats totaling 9 kilograms. These advanced satellites will test several new technologies: magnetic docking, GPS-based docking systems, and new rendezvous and docking algorithms. This is a joint project of NASA Langley Research Center and Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and is designated ELaNa-29 (Educational Launch of Nanosatellites).</p>
<p>The “Above the Clouds” launch, named to honor the hip hop album Moment of Truth&#8211;and specifically the fifth song on that album, “Above the Clouds”&#8211;is the first of at least four planned missions for Virgin Orbit in 2022. Virgin Orbit’s recent stock listing on the NASDAQ market, along with a crowded and rapidly changing smallsat launcher market, makes this year especially important for the company’s&#8211;and LauncherOne’s&#8211;future.</p>

The liftoff occurred at the opening of a 29-minute launch window at 10:25 AM EST (15:25 UTC) on Thursday, January 13, from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the third dedicated rideshare mission operated by SpaceX, which delivered 105 satellites to a 525-kilometer altitude Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO).</span></p>
<p><span id="more-83475"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making its tenth trip to space, the Falcon 9 booster supporting this mission is B1058-10, having previously supported SpaceX’s first crewed flight (<a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/tag/demo-2/">Demo-2</a>), the launch of the <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/07/spacex-launch-anasis-satellite-korea/">ANASIS-II telecommunications satellite</a>, the first resupply mission under the CRS2 contract (<a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/12/spacex-next-gen-cargo-dragon-crs21/">CRS-21</a>), SpaceX&#8217;s first dedicated rideshare mission (<a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/01/transporter-1-rideshare-program-debut/">Transporter-1</a>), and five <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink</a> launches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After launching on a southbound path along the Florida coast and separating from the second stage, the booster performed a boostback burn, followed by the entry and landing burns to return to Cape Canaveral and land on SpaceX’s Landing Zone 1 (LZ-1). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last RTLS landing was the <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/06/spacex-f9-transporter-2-rideshare/">Transporter-2 mission </a>in June of 2021.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On its way to orbit, the second stage performed a “dogleg” maneuver to keep its heading slightly west of due south to reach its desired orbital inclination, while avoiding overflight of populated areas.</span></p>

<p><b>Payloads</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceX’s rideshare program aims to enable frequent and economical access to popular orbits like the SSO, while also providing schedule flexibility to the customers. It costs as low as $1 million for a 200-kilogram payload headed to an SSO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onboard this mission is a plethora of small satellite payloads, most notably from Planet Inc. The Earth observation company has scheduled 44 SuperDoves satellites to launch as a part of their SkySat Constellation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kepler Communication is also launching six of its communication satellites as it aims to deliver networks all over the globe using small satellites in orbit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launching as well are payloads from Capella Space and Umbra Space, whose payloads are integrated and managed by Seattle-based launch integration company, Spaceflight Inc.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capella is launching additional satellites to grow its constellation of Very High Resolution, Low Latency, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites in orbit. Umbra Space is launching its second commercial SAR satellite, Umbra-02. Alongside Umbra SAR-2001, launched on the previous transporter mission, the company plans to establish its own SAR constellation of 24 such satellites.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spaceflight was originally planning to launch 13 co-manifested payloads. Ten of those payloads were planned to be deployed by their newly-developed chemical propulsion orbital transfer vehicle (OTV), Sherpa-LTC1. However, during integration of the spacecraft with SpaceX hardware, a propellant leak was discovered from the Sherpa’s propulsion system. There was no damage to the spacecrafts onboard the OTV, but the company decided not the fly it on Transporter-3 out of an abundance of caution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italy-based launch integration company D-Orbit will launch five CubeSats. Three of them will be launched for Poland-based company SatRevolution, and the other two for Aistech Space and Czech Aerospace Research Center (VZLU).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VZLU, in partnership with Spacemanic, will launch the VZLUSAT-2 satellite to verify technologies for a future Czech satellite constellation. Alongside an experimental camera and attitude control systems, there are second-generation devices onboard that have already been tested onboard the VZLUSAT-1 spacecraft, launched back in 2017. This payload was earlier scheduled to be launched onboard Spaceflight’s Sherpa but was then integrated at the last minute as the company teamed up with D-Orbit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exolaunch, a German launch services company, is also launching payloads for various companies and organizations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Arab Emirates will also be launching their nanosat named DEWASAT-1, which was developed by Dubai’s Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA).</span></p>
<p>Other payloads manifested for Transporter-3 include a pair of satellites managed by ISILaunch, two microsats for ICEYE, and multiple payloads from Spire. In total, 105 spacecraft are on board; the identity of every single payload has not been confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>Flight Profile</strong></p>
<p>Falcon 9 lifted off from SLC-40 and flew a southbound heading along the coast of Florida. The initial trajectory is driven by avoiding overflight of the populated areas of Florida. The first stage&#8217;s nine Merlin engines burned for approximately two minutes and 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Following stage separation, the second stage&#8217;s Merlin Vacuum engine ignited, beginning the six minute long burn toward an initial parking orbit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the first stage used its attitude control thrusters to perform a flip maneuver before reigniting three Merlin engines for the boostback burn. This burn nullified all of the booster&#8217;s horizontal velocity and then placed the stage on a trajectory back towards Landing Zone 1.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While the payload mass or destination orbit usually prevents the first stage from preserving the energy needed for this boostback burn, Transporter missions are usually relatively light and target low orbits, enabling this &#8220;Return to Launch Site&#8221; (RTLS) flight profile and removing the need for downrange drone ship recoveries.</p>
<p>The same three Merlin engines lit again to perform the entry burn, protecting the booster from reentry heating.</p>
<p>The single center engine then lit one final time to land B1058 on the pad at LZ-1.</p>
<p>Also to be recovered are the two payload fairing halves, which splash down as usual to be recovered by one of SpaceX&#8217;s multi-purpose vessels, Bob.</p>
<p>Back in space, the second stage performed a coast phase which lasted until T+ 55 minutes. A brief, two-second burn placed the upper stage and the payload stack into the final orbit. Payload deployments began at T+ 59 minutes and continued until T+ one hour and 27 minutes.</p>

The Commission filed a series of questions to SpaceX last month, which the company has now addressed.<br />
</span><span id="more-83398"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-LOA-20200526-00055/2378669"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, SpaceX requested a permit from the FCC to operate nearly 30,000 satellites in a new generation Starlink constellation they called “Gen2.”</span></p>
<p>This new constellation, as SpaceX explained, would be used to augment the capabilities of the first one and be able to serve more people at higher bandwidth and lower latency than the first generation constellation.</p>
<p><a href="https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-AMD-20210818-00105/12943361"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, SpaceX requested an amendment to the FCC to include two possible scenarios for this constellation: Configuration 1 and Configuration 2.</span></p>
<p>Configuration 1 would make use of Starship for the launch and deployment of all the satellites of this new constellation, as well as have a modified number of shells and orbital planes than the original. Configuration 2 would make use of Falcon 9 for launching and deploying all satellites – with its corresponding arrangement of orbital shells, planes, and satellites per plane.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last month the FCC asked SpaceX a series of questions about their next generation Starlink constellation, Starlink v2.0, or &quot;Gen2&quot;.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Last month, the FCC sent a letter to SpaceX asking for more details about this amendment. As expected, <a href="https://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=14456966">SpaceX replied this week</a>, responding to each of the questions and providing some interesting information.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter&#8217;s introduction opens with SpaceX complaining to the FCC, both about the lateness of the approval for filling and the lack of similar questions asked to other would-be competitors of Starlink.</span></p>
<p>SpaceX then noted that it has opted to go with &#8220;Configuration 1&#8221; instead of &#8220;Configuration 2&#8221; as an update to their plan, which translates to launching this second generation of Starlink satellites into orbit using Starship instead of Falcon 9.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the FCC asked about how SpaceX would operate this new constellation alongside its current generation of Starlinks, and if the terminals were capable of working with both Gen1 and Gen2 satellites, SpaceX noted its commitment to continue launching the 4,408 satellites of their first-generation constellation &#8211; having launched about 1,900 of them already &#8211; as well as deploying the next generation of satellites.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceX expanded by adding that it wants to operate both constellations simultaneously, noting “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just as terrestrial wireless networks meet customer demands by operating more than one generation of technology simultaneously, SpaceX plans to use both of its networks to provide superior service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><aside class="penci-sidebar-content widget l2-info"><h4 class="widget-title penci-border-arrow"><span class="inner-arrow">See Also</span></h4><ul><li><a href="https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=46726.0">Starlink FCC Filings</a></li><li><a href="https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=72.0">SpaceX Super Heavy/Starship Section</a></li><li><a href="https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=60.0">L2 SpaceX Section</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/l2/">Click here to Join L2</a></li></ul></aside></span></p>
<p>This includes launching replacement satellites later down the line to keep the first-generation constellation serviced while deploying Gen2 satellites. SpaceX also said that customer user terminals would be able to communicate through both constellations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FCC also asked SpaceX about the launch plans for Gen2, given that the company had said in the August 2021 amendment that they were considering two different configurations. As they did in the introduction, SpaceX noted that they intend to go ahead and launch these satellites using Starship alone.</span></p>
<p>“<span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceX has now reached a point in the development of its Starship launch vehicle and Gen2 satellites that it can concentrate solely on Configuration 1 and no longer pursue Configuration 2. SpaceX confirms here that it still intends to begin launching the Gen2 system as early as March 2022, likely beginning with the 43 degree or 53 degree inclined planes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p>That target date will almost certainly slip, given SpaceX is yet to launch the demonstration flight to orbital velocity. As such, the <span style="font-weight: 400;">readiness of Starship launching Gen2 satellites will be constrained by the readiness of several factors, including launch site readiness, the FAA approval of the Boca Chica Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA) and subsequent grant of the launch license, as well as the orbital test flights that might precede the first Starlink Gen2 launches.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Super Heavy Booster 3&#039;s LOX Tank Finally Scrapped | SpaceX Boca Chica" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZ8E_lDQm-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>When Starship enters the early operational phase, Starship launches from Boca Chica to the 43º and 53º orbital planes will also likely involve a substantial dogleg maneuver to avoid overflying parts of Mexico in the Yucatan peninsula.</p>
<p>This was contemplated by the PEA, as SpaceX might proceed with these launches with southern dogleg maneuvers, mirroring some of its Starlink launches on Falcon 9 from Florida and California in a similar fashion.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another interesting tidbit from the answers provided by SpaceX relates to the FCC asking how SpaceX intends to deploy its Gen2 satellites. SpaceX had previously noted on their fillings that they intended to launch these satellites “direct to station,” and Elon Musk himself had noted this a few months ago on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1420430105780891655?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceX clarified what it means with the term “direct to station,” noting the satellites won’t need to be inserted into a parking orbit to change orbital planes.</span></p>
<p>Starlink satellites that are currently launched on Falcon 9 have to be kept at a lower altitude for prolonged periods of time to phase their orbital planes into the required operational ones. With Starship, SpaceX claims, they could bypass this and launch directly into the orbital plane of the operational orbit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mechazilla&#039;s Chopsticks Moved and Tested At Last | SpaceX Boca Chica" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4MsI56HBRk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This doesn’t mean they’re going to be inserted directly into their operational altitudes. Instead, they’ll still be inserted into a low altitude to allow failed satellites to naturally reenter quickly while functioning satellites maneuver to their operational orbits. SpaceX points out that they might launch some of their satellites to a higher altitude directly, in some instances, such as when they launch rideshare payloads with Starlink, something that already occurs on Falcon 9.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceX also answered questions relating to Starlink’s satellite disposal reliability, on-orbit lifetime, and collision avoidance risks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceX says they expect Gen2 to meet or exceed Gen1’s post-mission disposal reliability, citing that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">these improvements will be built upon the solid foundation SpaceX has already established. Fewer than one-half of one percent of active satellites became non-maneuverable in the past year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p>In a worst-case scenario involving 1,900 active satellites &#8211; there are much less than that, as a few hundreds of them are still moving to operational orbits &#8211; and 0.5 percent of them failing, this would mean less than 10 satellites have become non-maneuverable in the past year.</p>
<p>SpaceX also claims that fully functional Gen2 satellites will have an on orbit lifetime similar to Gen1 satellites, which is five to seven years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceX also told the FCC they had performed two recent improvements on their automated collision avoidance system. </span>The system now uses two different providers for satellite conjunction data, ensuring that if one provider fails, the satellites can take data from the other one. The other improvement noted is that now, apart from performing a collision avoidance burn, Starlink satellites can orient themselves in order to reduce the probability of collision by at least an order of magnitude.</p>

(Credit: Mack Crawford for NSF/L2)</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other notable references to Gen2, the FCC asked SpaceX whether they would use deployment mechanisms for Gen2 satellite launches. SpaceX admitted that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while the deployment mechanism for the Starship launch vehicle is still being finalized, it may require tension rods.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpaceX&#8217;s responses to the FCC put in perspective the agile and rapid development pace that is seen with SpaceX, as well as the usual fail fast fix fast approach of the company, which is required to fulfill their goal of delivering internet access to underserved areas of the globe.</span></p>
<p>Well over a dozen Starlink flights are expected this year on Falcon 9. Depending on the progress at Boca Chica, the stage is also set for a rapid increase in Starlink deployment via the vastly superior Starship launch capability.</p>

<p>As commissioning comes to an end and project leads turn their attention to the calibration of IXPE&#8217;s first-of-their-kind instruments with the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant, NASASpaceflight spoke with Principal Investigator Dr. Martin Weisskopf about the status of the mission and how the first-of-its-kind telescope will be calibrated.</p>
<p><span id="more-83379"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=IXPE">IXPE itself is a joint project between NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center and the Italian Space Agency (ASI).</a> Placed into a 600 km (+/- 15 km) circular equatorial orbit inclined just 0.2 degrees to the Equator, the 330-kilogram IXPE deployed its solar arrays very shortly after separating from its launch vehicle while mission controllers prepared for the month-long commissioning phase.</p>
<p>The spacecraft completed the most critical step of this process on December 15 when the all-important boom containing the spacecraft’s three X-ray telescopes deployed successfully.</p>
<p>Without that deployment,<a href="https://www.asi.it/en/planets-stars-universe/alte-energie/ixpe/"> the IXPE mission would have ended before it could have begun as the telescopes need to be mounted away from the spacecraft’s main body to achieve the correct focal length for their observations</a>.</p>

<p>As Dr. Weisskopf stated regarding deployment, “For those of us in the space game, moving parts are always frightening.” Past missions,<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/galileo/overview/"> notably the Galileo space probe mission to orbit Jupiter,</a> have been affected by deployment failures.</p>

<p>With the commissioning phase for IXPE ending on Monday, January 10, Dr. Weisskopf described the entire process as having “gone incredibly smoothly,&#8221; &#8212; with the only issue of note being a “safe mode” event triggered by an unexpected aspect solution from the dual-head star cameras, which are used for navigation and tracking.</p>
<p>As Dr. Weisskopf explained, “One of the things [the cameras] do is they set a flag if the next X aspect solution, which occurs every second, is not the same as the expected one. And if that happens six times in a row, it sets another flag. And that other flag should not be tripped to go into safe mode. It’s just for information, but in this software, it was tripped on.”</p>
<p>A software update to avoid this issue has been implemented. Otherwise, commissioning went very well, with only occasional minor tweaks to procedures written before the launch &#8212; which is quite common.</p>
<p><a href="https://ixpe.msfc.nasa.gov">With commissioning complete, IXPE now must be calibrated.</a> To do that, the telescope&#8217;s first observation will be of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A beginning on Monday, January 10 &#8212; once commissioning ends.</p>

(Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)</p></div>
<p>Coincidentally, Cassiopeia A was also the Chandra X-ray Observatory’s first target, and Dr. Weisskopf works on both projects.</p>
<p>The IXPE observations of Cassiopeia A are scheduled to last 21 days, with only minor interruptions of a few minutes every orbit due to the observatory&#8217;s passage near the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-researchers-track-slowly-splitting-dent-in-earth-s-magnetic-field">The SAA is a region where the Van Allen radiation belts dip down to an altitude of approximately 190 km above Earth sea level, resulting in an influx of charged particles and higher radiation levels</a>.</p>
<p>As Dr. Weisskopf explained, “When our detectors see [the influx of charged particles from the SAA], they go crazy. We can’t take data than because it [would just be] swamped by that signal. There’s also an impact on the lifetime of the detector if we just bombarded them with X-ray particles. We just don’t want to do that”.</p>
<p>After the 21 days of planned observations of Cassiopeia A, 30 days of compilation and review will be conducted before the data is made public via the NASA HEASARC (High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center) website, <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov">located here</a>. After three months, data from observations will be archived a week after the observation is made &#8212; with IXPE planned to conduct an average of one study a week.</p>
<p><iframe title="NASA Explores Earth&#039;s Magnetic &#039;Dent&#039;" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qpdQcw_52iM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>After Cassiopeia A, other planned targets include magnetars &#8212; neutron stars with particularly intense magnetic fields &#8212; as well as black holes, galactic nuclei, quasars, pulsars, and blazars, along with targets of opportunity during the two-year primary mission.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to Dr. Weisskopf are the forthcoming studies of the polarization of magnetars &#8212; given his uncle wrote one of the first papers on magnetar magnetic fields in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Another particular target of note for Dr. Weisskopf is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-1-the-crab-nebula">the Crab Nebula supernova remnant</a> as he has written more papers about the nebula and its pulsar than any other object in his career.</p>
<p>As he describes the plans for observing this famous supernova remnant, “I want to look at the polarization as a function of the pulse phase. <a href="https://lasp.colorado.edu/home/missions-projects/quick-facts-oso-8/">I tried to do that with OSO-8, but we didn’t have enough photons in order to do anything but upper limits</a>. With IXPE, we’ll be able to nail this with high precision because IXPE is about 100 times more sensitive than OSO was”.</p>
<p>The OSO-8 mission, launched in 1975, was a pioneer in observing polarized X-rays from objects, light that vibrates in a particular direction that can provide insight into the physics of an object and the environment in which it formed.</p>

<p>Until now, <a href="https://chandra.harvard.edu">other X-ray observatories such as Chandra</a> could not detect whether X-rays were polarized.</p>
<p>The observations IXPE will make require the spacecraft to collect a large number of photons, which is the reason certain observations, like Cassiopeia A, will take up to 21 days. As Dr. Weisskopf stated, “We need those photons. Most of your signal is background. If it’s 5% polarized, that means 95% of the flux isn’t polarized.. and that’s just not helping”.</p>
<p>Although brighter extragalactic objects like quasars and blazars will be observed, IXPE won’t have the sensitivity required to go deeper in time and further out in space like the Chandra X-ray Observatory, <a href="https://hubblesite.org">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, and the James Webb Space Telescope can.</p>
<p>As a Small Explorer mission, IXPE is under strict cost limits and cannot afford the larger telescopes that would have allowed this capability.</p>
<p>The $188 million (US) mission is made possible by <a href="https://ixpe.msfc.nasa.gov/for_scientists/papers/2017spie_0829_sgro.pdf">the Gas Pixel Detectors (GPDs) made in Italy and provided by the Italian Space Agency</a>. These detectors are the heart of the spacecraft’s capabilities and use a dimethyl ether-helium gas mixture to trap photons that enter through a window made of beryllium.</p>

<p>The Italian Space Agency also provided <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2015/02/Malindi_station">the primary ground station IXPE communicates with: Malindi, Kenya</a>, on the Indian Ocean. In addition, a Finnish company (Oxford Instrument Technology OY) assisted with GPD assembly while Nagoya University in Japan provided the thermal shields.</p>
<p>Collaboration between NASA, the Italian Space Agency, and Colorado-based spacecraft contractor Ball Aerospace helped the mission proceed despite difficulties ranging from government furloughs to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Overall, IXPE is one of several astronomical space missions, large and small, that will paint a more complete picture of how the universe works.</p>
<p>Additionally, IXPE was one of two major international observatories launched in December 2021, <a href="https://youtu.be/5rARTOhbLDg?t=5709">with the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope following IXPE on December 25 on an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana</a>.</p>
<p>Webb successfully completed its <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2022/01/jwst-sunshield-deployment/">never-before-attempted unfolding process on Saturday, January 8</a>, with a five-and-a-half-month commissioning and cool-down phase to follow.</p>

<p>The feat capped an impressive series of engineering accomplishments, with all major critical deployments that could have ended the mission outright passing without major issue. Final mirror deployment followed the successful unfurling of the massive sunshield &#8212; a first-of-its-kind operation that saw Northrop Grumman’s decades of work on the project come to fruition.</p>
<p><span id="more-83387"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5rARTOhbLDg?t=5709">James Webb successfully launched atop an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket on December 25, 2021, from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana</a>. T+29 minutes after launch, the telescope successfully deployed its solar array four minutes ahead of schedule due to the near-perfect performance of the Ariane 5 rocket.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/12/ariane-5-webb-launch/">The deployment accuracy of the Ariane 5 was so good that the amount of propellant remaining on JWST will allow the observatory to operate for nearly 20 years &#8212; 10 years longer than originally expected.</a></p>
<p>Three days after launch marked the beginning of the sunshield’s deployment sequence with the deployment of the forward and aft Utilized Pallet Structures (UPS). JWST’s sunshield is a mission-critical, 14.162 × 21.197 meter, five-layer membrane, used to cool the observatory and block the light and heat from the Sun.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/11/commissioning-jwst-1/">At T+5 days, the retraction of the sunshield covers occurred, exposing the five sunshield membrane layers to the harsh environment of space and setting up the most critical part of telescope&#8217;s sunshield deployment sequence: mid-boom deployment and sunshield membrane tensioning</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="James Webb Space Telescope Deployment Sequence (Nominal)" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzGLKQ7_KZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The sunshield mid-booms successfully deployed at T+6 days. The booms are attached to the shield membranes, and when deployed, pulled out the entire shield.</p>
<p>After a two day break to allow teams to learn more about how JWST was operating in space, tensioning of the five sunshield membranes began on January 3, 2022, and concluded on January 4 &#8212; completing the sunshield deployment sequence.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/12/james-webb-deployment-sequence-underway/">“It’s [been] a little surreal to me because I’ve been on the program so long,” related Marc Roth, vehicle engineering mechanical and commissioning deployments lead for operations at Northrop Grumman who has been with the program for over eight years.</a></p>
<p>“I had gotten used to seeing the vehicle and the hardware and being present with it just about every day on the ground. It&#8217;s basically been at a full assembly level over the sunshield for about four and a half years, give or take, since mid-2017. It almost didn&#8217;t feel real that we were deploying it on orbit because we had seen it deploy every other time before that.”</p>
<p>Joe Sprofera, dynamics lead for the JWST program at <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=Northrop+Grumman">Northrop Grumman</a>, added, “I started on it when I started at Northrop. The one thing I&#8217;ve known the entire time,” he said while reflecting on his 16 years with the program.</p>
<p>For the deployment sequence itself and what kind of data teams were looking at during the critical process, Hillary Stock, deployment specialist at Northrop Grumman specializing in the sunshield, related, “When we&#8217;re actually running the tensioning operations, we&#8217;re driving motors, and those motors have a handful of telemetry points that we&#8217;re looking at.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“We get the motor current, the motor&#8217;s position, and we&#8217;re understanding how it&#8217;s responding to resistance. There&#8217;s certain events that occurred during tensioning that we use as benchmarks to know we&#8217;re in the right spot, we have the right load; and it gives us a big insight into how the whole system is responding.”</p>
<p>Hillary continued, saying, “We&#8217;re looking for those little benchmark telemetry signatures as we&#8217;re going through each motor move in each operation. So that&#8217;s really why we&#8217;re all here is we&#8217;re watching that motor telemetry, and we know what to look for based on experience with the hardware.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not necessarily a specific value, it&#8217;s not something you can flag with an alarm. It&#8217;s more a trend in the data and an observation based on how the motor&#8217;s performing at the time.”</p>
<p>Marc continued, saying, “What we do have in the system are fault limits. We don&#8217;t expect to see the system respond with us going towards those fault limits, but they are in place just in case we reach them because of some unknown out there. In terms of the sunshield tensioning, we didn&#8217;t get near any of them.”</p>
<p>To the performance of the overall sunshield deployment system, Joe reflected: “I couldn&#8217;t have been happier with the way it went overall. It was, once we&#8217;ve gotten into that tensioning phase, as smooth as it could have been, really. It was pretty incredible to complete it, especially within two days [of the fastest possible schedule] &#8212; which I think exceeded all of our expectations.”</p>
<p>Marc agreed: “Every time I would ask, everyone was pleasantly surprised that we were running very, very nominal and basically repeating some of our ground deployment scenarios. So it was very easy to line up data and know that everything was going so well.”</p>

<p>With a first-of-its-kind system like the sunshield, extensive testing is part of the requirements of such a critical spacecraft system, and the JWST sunshield was tested extensively on the ground. However, exact deployment conditions cannot be replicated on Earth.</p>
<p>“When we got into the on-orbit deployments having not done a zero-G deployment before, we [really had] a minimum predict and a maximum predict,” related Hillary. “We [were] just hoping to fit somewhere within our predictions, and to see us coming right in dead center as we would hope and expect was a great moment.”</p>
<p>Marc continued, “We were basically characterizing the vehicle since the day of launch and seeing how things behaved and warmed up or cooled down. Some of those things required us to take some different actions, go back to our factory support team and see if we could open up some thresholds on running a motor a little bit warmer than expected.”</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/csa_asc/status/1479518223485784074">“We had to do a couple pitch maneuvers on the vehicle to get into a more favorable attitude so we could get our temperatures where we needed them to be to start the deployment.</a> But we had in our minds that if we needed to take a pause, the vehicle was safe at any point and we could stand down, get a good assessment of the data, and then come up with a path forward.”</p>
<p>“We didn&#8217;t feel rushed at any point within ourselves or from the program, which was great. They were all just willing to listen to our recommendations and give us the time we needed to make sure it was safe to do the deployments.”</p>
<p>Following the successful deployment of the mid-booms on December 31, 2021, sunshield tensioning was expected to begin on January 1, 2022. However, this was delayed to January 3 to “learn more about how Webb behaves in space,” per a NASA/ESA/CSA release at the time.</p>

December 2021 saw three major visiting vehicle movements, one spacewalk, and many of the research and maintenance tasks that allow the ISS to function as one of the world&#8217;s most important scientific laboratories.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-83354"></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Expedition 66 crew currently aboard the station is commanded by Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, who is joined by cosmonaut Pyotr Dubrov along with NASA astronauts Mark Vande Hei, Raja Chari, Thomas Marshburn, and Kayla Barron, and the European Space Agency&#8217;s Matthias Maurer. Dubrov and Vande Hei have been aboard the station since April, while Shkaplerov arrived in October and the remaining crew members in November.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Visiting Vehicles</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At the beginning of December, four visiting spacecraft were docked at the space station. On the Russian side, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/10/soyuz-ms-19-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Soyuz MS-19</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> was at the nadir – Earth-facing – port of the Rassvet module, with </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/10/progress-ms18-launch-docking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Progress MS-18</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> at the aft port of the Zvezda and Progress M-UM occupying the nadir port of Prichal.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">IDA-F is the Forward International Docking Adaptor, one of two docking adaptors added to the U.S. segment of the station to convert the Pressurized Mating Adaptors (PMAs) from their Shuttle-era APAS-95 docking standard to the International Docking System Standard (IDSS) that is implemented by the Commercial Crew vehicles: Dragon and Starliner. Officially, the adaptors are still designated IDA-2 and IDA-3 (IDA-1 having been lost in a launch failure); however, flight controllers have increasingly been referring to them by their positions on the station in its most common orientation.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">IDA-2, which faces in the station&#8217;s direction of travel, has therefore become the Forward IDA, or IDA-F; IDA-3 is also known as Zenith IDA, or IDA-Z, due to its position on the Earth-opposed side of Harmony.</span></p>

The spacecraft&#8217;s descent module landed on the steppes of Kazakhstan on December 20.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The second arrival of the month came on December 22 with a SpaceX Dragon v2 in its cargo configuration flying the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/12/nasa-spacex-crs-24-iss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CRS-24 mission</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. On the second visit to the ISS for this particular Dragon, it successfully docked with the IDA-Z adaptor. As well as its usual cargo of crew provisions, science, and new or spare parts for the space station, launching so close to Christmas the CRS-24 mission also brought up presents for the crew. The cargo also included several small satellites which will be released from the station during 2022.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before Dragon&#8217;s docking, the Mobile Transporter with the station&#8217;s Candarm2 robotic arm &#8211; officially the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/?s=SSRMS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS)</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> &#8211; was repositioned to Worksite 2 to allow it to extract the unpressurized cargo from Dragon&#8217;s Trunk. The relocation of the Mobile Transporter was completed on December 17.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With Dragon docked, the crew entered the pressurized capsule to extract cargo and begin replacing it with hardware to be returned to Earth. The spacecraft is expected to remain docked until late January. Dragon is the only uncrewed spacecraft that regularly visits the ISS which is designed to be recovered, giving it the unique ability to return large volumes of cargo to the Earth rather than disposing of them via reentry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Also on December 22 came the departure of Progress M-UM. This was a specially-modified version of Russia&#8217;s Progress freighter that had been used as a tug to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/11/prichal-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">deliver the Prichal docking module in late November</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> – the module taking the place of the Progress&#8217; usual pressurized cargo space. Having successfully delivered Prichal, the Progress M-UM instrument module, or Priborno Agregatniy Otsek (PAO), had remained docked for about a month before meeting its demise in a planned destructive reentry a few hours after leaving the station.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Aside from arrivals and departures, the docked Progress MS-18 spacecraft was called upon to make two orbit adjustments for the station during the month. On December 1, a close approach between the station and a piece of orbital debris was identified, with a possibility of collision on December 3. The debris was part of the upper stage of a Pegasus rocket that launched the US Air Force&#8217;s STEP-2 satellite in 1994 and had subsequently disintegrated in orbit. This was determined to be a high-concern conjunction, resulting in a pre-planned debris avoidance maneuver (PDAM) being scheduled for December 3, a few hours before closest approach.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During this process the Russian Orbital Segment&#8217;s attitude control thrusters took over responsibility for the station&#8217;s orientation, transitioning it to a retrograde posture with the aft end of the station &#8211; and the thrusters of the Progress MS-18 spacecraft &#8211; pointing in the direction of travel. Progress MS-18 began a 160.9-second burn at 07:58 UTC, reducing the station&#8217;s velocity by 0.3 meters per second and its orbital altitude by approximately 310 meters to ensure there was no potential of a collision. At the end of the burn, control was transferred back to the US Orbital Segment which returned the station to its normal attitude.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The second burn from Progress MS-18 was for a reboost. This began at 01:18 UTC on December 24, lasting eight minutes and 59.4 seconds as Progress increased the station&#8217;s orbital speed by 1.06 meters per second and its orbital altitude by 1.8 kilometers.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Onboard Science</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the International Space Station&#8217;s most important roles is to serve as an orbiting science laboratory, helping us gain new insights into our universe and life here on Earth. The crew has a vital role in this, carrying out some experiments and investigations while also setting up, maintaining, and monitoring others that are controlled from the ground.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They are also test subjects for life sciences research aboard the outpost, including studies of how humans respond to long-duration spaceflight. As part of this, the crew is equipped with Actiwatch Plus activity monitors to track their sleep and activities, with the devices being periodically charged by USB.</span></p>

<p>Several crew exercise sessions, both on the treadmill and the cycle ergometer, were carried out by astronauts wearing an EasyMotion suit, monitoring electro-myo-stimulation. Data collected on orbit, as well as from pre- and post-flight experiments, will help study muscle tone and stiffness in space.</p>
<p>To support Vascular Aging research, the crew used the Echo ultrasound experiment for a series of scans under the guidance of scientists on the ground and to take blood pressure readings and glucose tests. This research is aimed at studying how spaceflight appears to speed up the aging process of astronauts&#8217; cardiovascular systems and will help mitigate the health impacts of long-term missions.</p>
<p>As well as the astronauts, several mice are aboard the International Space Station as part of the Rodent Research 18 (RR-18) experiment, which aims to study how long-duration space missions affect the test subject&#8217;s eyesight. Astronauts are responsible for periodically restocking the rodent enclosure and carrying out other operations as required.</p>
<p>In preparation for a new experiment arriving with the CRS-24 Dragon, the crew removed and replaced parts of the station&#8217;s Advanced Plant Habitat, including the carbon dioxide (CO2) pump filter, environmental control system, and CO2 and ethylene scrubbers. After Dragon arrived, the Plant Habitat 05 growth chamber was installed in the Advanced Plant Habitat. This will grow cotton plants in microgravity to study their reproductive behavior.</p>
<p>As well as life sciences, materials research also occupies a significant amount of laboratory time aboard the station. The crew serviced and inspected the Materials Science Research Rack 1 (MSRR-1) and changed out the Solidification and Quench Furnace (SQF) in the Materials Science Laboratory (MSL). Later in the month, the MSSR and MSL sample cartridge assemblies were changed out ahead of the next series of experiments to begin in January 2022.</p>
<p>The crew also prepared the Materials International Space Station Experiment 14 (MISSE-14) samples, which previously had been mounted outside the station, for their return to Earth. Meanwhile, the Manufacturing Device (MAND), a 3D printer, was used to produce a series of zero-degree panels for testing on-orbit.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another experiment, Investigating the Structure of Paramagnetic Aggregates from Colloidal Ellipsoids 4 (InSPACE-4), has been an ongoing study of the formation of miniature structures in colloids when exposed to a magnetic field in microgravity. The crew redistributed the sample particles, configured, adjusted, and activated the equipment for a series of test runs throughout the month. After the last run of the year on December 21, InSPACE-4 was removed from the Microgravity Glovebox and stowed.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As part of a long-term educational outreach program, the crew used the station&#8217;s amateur radio equipment to communicate with students at schools in the United States, Germany, and Japan during several overhead passes throughout the month.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Station Upkeep</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the only humans aboard the space station, its crew are responsible for all aspects of its mission that cannot be controlled remotely from the ground. As well as conducting scientific research, this also means carrying out the day-to-day preventative maintenance tasks that keep the outpost operational, in addition to larger-scale modifications and repairs as necessary.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At the beginning of the month, the crew removed and replaced the Space Integrated GPS Inertial 2 (SIGI-2) receiver. This uses the US Air Force&#8217;s Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites to help determine the station&#8217;s location, velocity, and attitude in orbit. Following installation, the replacement unit was tested but found to have a worse-than-expected signal-to-noise ratio, rendering it unable to read data from the satellites. The astronauts re-checked its connections the following day, and despite not finding any deficiencies, the unit was then able to acquire a signal.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The first day of the month also saw final preparations for a spacewalk by astronauts Thomas Marshburn and Kayla Barron, which began at 11:15 UTC on December 2 and lasted six hours and 32 minutes. </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/12/us-eva-78/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The primary objective of this EVA was to replace an S-Band Subassembly (SASA) on the station&#8217;s P1 truss</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Two SASA antennas aboard the station are used to facilitate control, telemetry, and voice communications with flight controllers on the ground; however, the port-side one had failed a routine test in September when it was found to be providing no downlink capability.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Marshburn and Barron successfully removed the failed assembly and replaced it with a spare that had been delivered in 2011 during </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/tag/sts-134/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Space Shuttle Endeavour&#8217;s final mission, STS-134</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The failed SASA was installed on ExPRESS Logistics Carrier 3 (ELC-3), which had previously hosted the spare unit. With this completed, the astronauts finished several get-ahead tasks before returning to the Quest airlock.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The day after the spacewalk, the crew carried out a debriefing and regular post-EVA inspections and cleanup for several days, including operations to recharge the space suits&#8217; water systems and batteries, scrub and decontaminate the cooling systems, and stow the equipment.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some multi-layer insulation from the SASA&#8217;s support assembly that was brought inside the station on the EVA was found to be covered in what was described as a &#8220;sparse, very fine, uniform, sparkly material&#8221; which was also present in an Orbital Replacement Unit (ORU) bag that had been used during the spacewalk and on the gloves of one of the spacesuits. After the insulation was securely bagged for disposal, the astronauts used tape to clean the bag and the spacesuit for future use.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The spacesuits used for the EVA were Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) numbers 3006 and 3009. This is expected to be the last use of 3006 before it is returned to Earth for maintenance aboard the CRS-24 Dragon spacecraft.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A computer networking issue developed late on December 2 when the Joint Station Local Area Network (JSL) went offline, impacting the transfer of data between systems across the station. After the crew awoke, they were able to restart a router, Lab Router 1, which restored most connectivity.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After a conflict was identified between the two lab firewalls, one was powered down &#8212; which restored the remaining network functionality. On December 6, the crew replaced an ethernet cable between the two firewalls, which was found to be defective, allowing the powered-down unit to be brought back online and full redundancy restored. An incorrect re-connection between the JSL and the European Space Agency&#8217;s network via the Node 2 Router, which had disrupted ESA operations since upgrades were carried out in October, was also found and removed.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On December 7, the Oxygen Generation Assembly (OGA) detected an unexpected increase in water in its Rotary Separator Accumulator (RSA) and initiated a rapid shutdown. Ground teams reviewed the data and, after determining that it was a known issue and there was no evidence of a leak, the system was brought back online using a backup sensor. The following day, a separate issue with the OGA was identified, with pressure in Nitrogen Purge Orbital Replacement Unit (N2 Purge ORU) falling far more quickly than expected &#8211; indicating a leak.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the station reoriented itself back to its normal orientation following the Soyuz docking on December 8, one of the Beta Gimbal Assemblies (BGAs) used to enable the station&#8217;s main solar arrays to track the sun stalled and failed to recover automatically. This returned to normal operation shortly after the reorientation maneuver had been completed and was not considered to be of significant concern &#8211; although an alarm did wake the crew.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meanwhile, several issues with the Urine Processor Assembly occurred throughout the month. On December 8, the crew reported a smell coming from the Brine Processor Assembly (BPA), which recovers water from the astronauts&#8217; waste products.
